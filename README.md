# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In this procedure, we are using Python to use multiple machine learning models to predict credit risk. 
Models used:
- Oversampling
- Undersampling
- SMOTEENN algorithm using both oversampling and undersampling.
- Use of BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.

## Results

### RandomOverSampler Model

- Balance Accuracy of 78.8%
- high risk precision is about 4%
